    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <p>
        I possess over 10 years of professional team member experience. From construction and PC deployment, to technical support and maintenance groups, my entire professional life has involved working with groups of individuals to accomplish common goals.
        I also have 5 years of professional leadership experience as a former manager of an online support team. I had to create and conduct spoken and visual presentations and tutorials for cohorts of students every 3 months during my time as a manager.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I have a passion for helping others. One way in which I accomplish this is by organizing a sandwich assembling team to make sandwiches which go towards feeding D.C.'s homeless, via Central Union Mission and New Hope Church of God.
